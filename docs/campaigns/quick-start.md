Start here: https://memberdrive.org/signup

It's not much good having a campaign without a way to accept payments. Fortunately, that's easy to set up. 

* [Connect your Stripe account](campaigns/connect-stripe)  
  Stripe is a third-party service that lets you accept credit card and bank payments.
* [Connect BTCPay Server](campaigns/connect-bitcoin)  
  BTCPay Server lets you accept Bitcoin donations directly to your own wallet with no third-party.
